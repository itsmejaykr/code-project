# Mapping Educational Landscape
The Mapping Educational Landscape project aims to analyze, visualize, and understand the distribution, accessibility, and quality of educational institutions within a specific region or across multiple regions. It leverages data collection, geospatial mapping, and analytical tools to provide insights into factors such as infrastructure, enrollment rates, teacher availability, and educational outcomes. The project helps policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders identify gaps, trends, and opportunities in the education sector to support data-driven decision-making.

Key Features:

Data Collection & Integration:
Aggregates data from government portals, school databases, and surveys to create a comprehensive dataset of educational institutions.

Geospatial Mapping:
Utilizes GIS (Geographic Information System) tools to plot schools, colleges, and universities on interactive maps for easy visualization.

Categorization of Institutions:
Classifies institutions by type (primary, secondary, higher education), management (public/private), and medium of instruction.

Accessibility Analysis:
Maps proximity of educational institutions to population centers, transportation facilities, and rural or underprivileged areas.

Performance Metrics:
Displays key performance indicators (literacy rate, student–teacher ratio, pass percentage, etc.) for comparative analysis.

Interactive Dashboard:
Provides a user-friendly dashboard for filtering, analyzing, and exporting data insights.

Policy Insights & Recommendations:
Identifies underserved regions and offers recommendations for resource allocation and policy improvement.
